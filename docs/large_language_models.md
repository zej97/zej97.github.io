- **[CS324 - Large Language Models](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/)**
The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been transformed by massive pre-trained language models. They form the basis of all state-of-the-art systems across a wide range of tasks and have shown an impressive ability to generate fluent text and perform few-shot learning. At the same time, these models are hard to understand and give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them.
