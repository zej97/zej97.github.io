Welcome to the **{{ site.title }}**'s blog!

Here you will find a collection of articles about recommender systems. The articles are written by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ze-jin-7219531b2/) and are based on my experience in the industry. Furthermore, I will share some knowledge that I have acquired, such as game theory and LLM. I hope you will find them useful.

In 2020, I graduated from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I immersed myself in a variety of computer science subjects, including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. By designing and developing a single-cycle CPU, a compiler, and complex software systems, I acquired practical skills and knowledge that helped me gain a holistic understanding of computer science.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in financial computing at [the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics). This program has been an incredibly enriching experience, as I have been exposed to a wide range of financial concepts and technologies.

During the period between 2020 and 2022, I had the privilege of interning at the recommendation departments of two globally recognized companies, namely [Kwai](https://www.kwai.com/) and [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/). The experience was priceless, and I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the whole lifecycle of giant recommendation systems and valuable practical experience. I am grateful to both companies for the opportunities I had to work with them and the knowledge I gained during my time there.

If you have come across this blog, I would be delighted to engage with you in any discussion related to the topics that I address. These topics range from current events to personal experiences that have shaped my worldview. I am always eager to learn from others and expand my knowledge base, so please do not hesitate to share your thoughts and opinions with me. I welcome any and all conversations that can broaden our perspectives and foster mutual understanding.
