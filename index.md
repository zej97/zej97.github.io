Welcome to the **{{ site.title }}** blog!

Here you will find a collection of articles about recommender systems. The articles are written by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ze-jin-7219531b2/) and are based on my experience in the industry of recommender systems. In addition, I will share some knowledge I learned like game theory. I hope you will find them useful. For me, writing is a way to learn. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. I will be very grateful. 

In 2020, I got my bechelor of engineering degree in computer science from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/). I am currently a master student at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and studing financial computing. Unfortunately, after actually studying for a while, I found that I have no interest in finance.

For some reasons, I was not able to attend NYU to continue my computer science education after receiving an offer in 2020. Instead, I interned at the recommendation departments of [Kwai](https://www.kwai.com/) and [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) between 2020 and 2022. I am extremely grateful to both companies for giving me the opportunity to work with them and for all the knowledge I gained during my time there.

If you happen to come across this blog, feel free to discuss any topic with me.
